# InstaBot
## Project goal
The aim of this project is to build a telegram bot, that accepts an image as a file or photo and uploads it to
Instagram. It also adds appropriate hashtags and geotags based on image data. Video and gallery support could be added
at later stages of the project.

## Architecture
The project architecture could be [found here](https://bitbucket.org/kpcg/instabot/wiki/Home)

Basically, each worker lives in a separate subdirectory and has it's own README

## Running
